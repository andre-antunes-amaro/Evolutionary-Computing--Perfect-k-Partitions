# Evolutionary-Computing--Perfect-k-Partitions

This project investigates the perfect k-partition problem through evolutionary computation techniques. A stochastic discrete simulation was developed in Python to model the evolution of a population of individuals, each representing a k-partition, with the aim of guiding the population towards an efficient solution.
